On Project development, there should be the `main` or `master` branch that the stable version of the website/application should be saved. There will be a `develop` branch where the advanced version of the website application which may potentially has bugs and errors. And also the `feature` branches, you can name the feature branch related to what feature it being developed.

Below will be the command guidelines.

## Basic Control Flow

![Version Control Flow](version-control-flow.webp)

### Guidelines

`main` branch should only have the version of the website application that is STABLE, which means it is tested and bug free. **Avoid merging** the `develop` branch to `main` if the codes is still not yet tested. Wait for the project manager's approval if needed.

`develop` branch will have the compiled codes of all the `feature` branches which means it is the ADVANCED version of the STABLE. That will also means that it might contain bugs and error that is not yet discovered.

After finishing a feature branch, merge it to the `develop` branch. Add the develop codes first your the feature branch to check if there is an error on merging, before you merge the feature to the develop branch. Run below commands

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="you can name the feature branch any name you want but it should be relevant to the feature being develop" />}}

{{< details "Git Commands On Developing a Feature" >}}

Create your branch if it still does not exist.

```sh
git checkout -b feature_name
```

or

```sh
git switch -c feature_name
```

---

after updating any changes. Create a checkpoint so if you make any errors, you can go back to previous version.

```sh
git add .
```

```sh
git commit -m "commit comment"
```

---

To see all your current logs.

```sh
git log
```

To limit the number of logs like for example 2

```sh
git log -2
```

To see the log in one line. Note: The long hash is just the same with the short hash.

```sh
git log --online
```

To checkout other version of your codes

```sh
git checkout
```

It will make a detached HEAD. to get back to your current work just switch to branch

```sh
git switch branch_name
```

---

To revert previous commit

```sh
git revert HEAD
```

to revert other commits. use the hash code you find when you generates a log to see the commits.

```sh
git revert log_code
```

For example: Below codes are generated using `git log --oneline` if you checkout the `c6244bf` and you would like to revert to that version. You have to revert the `d7fea52` commit.

```sh
a1b6c00 (HEAD -> master) M4
d7fea52 M3
c6244bf M2
d84caf1 M1
```

please note that revert will creates a new commit.

---

after end of the day, update the remote repository for backup and as well as other developer might work on it. Please note that when pushing a local repository that do not have a remote repository, it will ask you to run 1 more command so please read the git notification. If you already have existing branch, make sure you run `git pull` first before you push changes.

```sh
git push
```

When you are going back to work on your feature. make sure you are in the correct branch (green branch means it is the one selected)

```sh
git branch --list
```

if you are not in the correct branch, switch to your branch.

```sh
git switch feature_branch
```

And also make sure that your codes are update whenever you are just starting to work with an existing branch.

```sh
git pull
```

{{< details "Git Commands to Apply the Features to Develop Branch" >}}

1. go to your local repository `develop` branch

```sh
git switch develop
```

2. make sure that your local repository `develop` branch is updated

```sh
git pull
```

3. switch to the feature1 branch

```sh
git switch feature1
```

4. make sure your local repository `feature1` branch is updated

```sh
git pull
```

5. get the updated codes from the `develop` branch to your `feature1` branch

```sh
git merge develop
```

6. Fix the merge conflicts and after testing that it is working fine. You can switch to the `develop` branch and get the updated codes from the `feature1` branch.

```sh
git switch develop
```

```sh
git merge feature1
```

7. Fix the merge conflicts again. then push your updated `develop` branch codes from your local repository to the remote repository.

```sh
git push
```

If the develop branch code version is already well-tested by the team with no issue. we can now then push the changes to the main branch which is our STABLE version of your website application project.

{{< details "Git Commands to Update the Stable Version" >}}

1. Switch to the develop branch and make sure it is updated

```sh
git switch develop
```

```sh
git pull
```

2. Switch to the main branch and make sure it is updated

```sh
git switch main
```

```sh
git pull
```

3. Merge or absorb the updated codes from the develop branch

```sh
git merge develop
```

4.after fixing the merge conflict. push the updated codes to the git remote repository

```sh
git push
```
